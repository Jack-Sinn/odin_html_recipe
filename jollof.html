        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Nigerian Stock</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, process ginger and garlic with 2 cups (475ml) water until thoroughly blended.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, combine beef and chicken bones with onion, bell pepper, and habanero (if using). Pour ginger-garlic mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into pot, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible before discarding the fiber.</li>
            <li>Add curry powder, dried thyme, bay leaves, black pepper, and a large pinch of salt. Add enough additional water to just cover all solid ingredients (about 2 1/2 quarts; 2.5L); stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the stock is aromatic and the vegetables are soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Off heat, remove the bones with a pair of tongs; if there’s meat on the bones, you can pull it off later as a snack, but otherwise discard the bones.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables and bay leaves to the blender and puree with 1 cup (225ml) of stock until homogenous and smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour pureed vegetables through a fine-mesh strainer back into stock, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard remaining vegetable matter trapped in the strainer. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Use stock as desired, or store in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Jellof</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For the Stew Base: In a blender jar, combine tomatoes, red pepper, onion, Scotch bonnet or habanero, and stock. Blend until a smooth puree forms, about 2 minutes. This will yield just shy of 5 cups (1.18L).</li>
            <li>Transfer the stew base to a 3-quart saucier or saucepan, cover partially with a lid to contain splatter, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally, until reduced by half (roughly about 2 1/2 cups; 590ml), about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>For the Jollof Rice: In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add half the sliced onion along with the bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, a large pinch of salt, and a large pinch of black or white pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fragrant and the onions soften slightly, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and 2 teaspoons (8g) butter. Cook, stirring continuously, until the tomato paste darkens, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in reserved stew base, cover partially with the lid to prevent splattering, and cook at a gentle simmer over medium-low heat until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and pepper; if the curry flavor is lacking, you can add more to taste (the curry powder should come through pleasantly but not be overpowering, though this is a question of personal taste).</li>
            <li>Stir in rice until evenly coated in sauce. Cover the pot with a double piece of foil or parchment paper, crimped down around the edges to seal, then top with lid (this will trap steam to lock in the flavor and aid cooking).</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to the lowest possible and cook for 20 minutes, then uncover pot and gently stir rice to redistribute. Cover again and continue to cook until rice is just cooked through but still retains a firm bite and the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 15 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>If rice is undercooked and/or still wet, cover and cook 5 minutes longer.</li>
        </ol>
